<h1 align="center"> 🎤 Fake Mute & Deafen <sup>🗣️</sup> 🎧 </h1>

<p align='center'>
  <b>Allows you to fake mute/deafen yourself in Discord which grants you the ability to hear/speak whilst the mute/deafen icon appears.</b><br>
</p>

##  Usage:
```js
  * Add to BetterDiscord plugins folder.
```

##  Plans:
- [ ] Add buttons to mute / deafen seperately and not from the plugin being enabled.
- [ ] Use BDApi
